Seeing the seiyuu try to sell this anime and act excited about is... really... weird........ \A The color pencil effect, while somewhat unique for a super-limited-animation gag anime, looks really artificial and almost generic. I think I prefer the art style of Teekyuu more, but this show has some really good character designs in Sora and Miyako (though Ayako's design is boring). \A Kinako is best girl, I adore her low-pitched voice and off-color remarks. also KINAKO IN A SUIT <3 \A that Teekyuu crossover tho";

content: "\A The transformation sequence animations (for Dream, Rouge, and Lemonade especially) are AMAZING. \A I salute Hironori Tanaka for making the best two episodes of the show, 4 and 18, as beautiful as they are. \A Syrup's a mailman and that's why I like him. It's so cute that he looks up to Santa Clause... he's so cute. And as always, Miruku and Urara are great. \A The villains are pretty cool this time around. They're basically dimension-jumping curio collectors. Anacondy's got a cool design (and the actually-Medusa twist is FUCKING KINO), Shibiretta has a REALLY cool gimmick in her fairy tail pocket dimensions, Yadokhan and Isohgin are legitimately funny, Mucardia takes a new and deceitful approach, and Bunbee is forever. \A The one thing that really bothers me about this season is the Precure splitting up in fights and getting solo special moves. I know it's because they want to explore pairings that don't involve all five of them, but it just feels weird because in the first three Precure, it was such a huge plotpoint that they NEEDED to hold hands in order to pull off their finishing moves. Also, more time replaying stock special move animations means less time spent on actual physical fight animation. The Fleurets are a particularly bad offender. \A The finale really ties everything together. This is the BEST Precure's symbolism and theming has been so far.";
