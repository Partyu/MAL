content: "\A Based off what I can remember, Death Billiards' rules and setup were better. \A When it comes to this show, \"Episodic anime with an overarching plot\" essentially means \"We'll spend 20 minutes every episode focusing on characters who you don't care about, who aren't interesting, and who you'll never see again, and maybe if we have a minute or two leftover we'll dripfeed you information about the characters who actually matter.\" The information comes in so slowly, that by the time the show has decided \"We're ready to focus on the overarching plot now!\" I just can't bring myself to care. \A The first half of the show is basically trying to say, \"Average people react to extreme situations with extreme emotions.\" But the show's structure just makes this fucking boring. Either make the show non-episodic and focus on a few, tightly-written character arcs, that actually show a steady progression from point A to point B. Or drop the \"average\" schtick entirely and make the one-offs some crazy, charismatic motherfuckers who immediately command your attention. It's not as if episodic, one-off characters can't work, either. Just make them secondary and put the focus on the reoccuring cast. Decim and the woman end up feeling like side characters in their own goddamn show. Do we even get to see what Decim judgements were? Do we even get that little amount of characterization? This anime is 75% padding, and the 25% of actual content is so sparse and so shallow. \A Ep1: breeder shit, zzzzzzz \A Ep2: Wow I sure do love the show deciding we as the viewers are too fucking stupid to analyze the themes of the first episode and come to a conclusion about the characters' actions ourselves given the clues the script and visuals provide. \"Wow haha he didn't miss the board on purpose haha humans sure are interesting!\" Dude this shit is so fucking boring. Just the writers circlejerking about their own script. It's not an inherently boring idea, but at least pull it with interesting characters and an interesting conflict instead of two fuck-off nobodies and their paternity testing. \A Ep3: Maybe this would be cute if I actually gave a shit about any of these people? Everybody in this show is a fucking normie, reeeee. Why would I care about a twist if I don't care about the characters? \A Ep4: The girl's seiyuu fucking sucks at crying. Fighting game animations are entertaining, but the game itself is wayyy more passive. The most interesting part of the episode is Decim being a dick lol. \A Ep5: So like what happens when a baby who died one minute out the womb comes to Quindecim? I got excited when the kid turned heel, but in the end only the recurring characters can have fun personalities, huh.... Also Ginti looks really bad from the front. His head and neck look too big for his body. \A Ep6: Cool to see another set. ...uh, why do they have to pee in purgatory? Aren't they dead? That pantsu shot audio cue lmao. HOW IS HE GRABBING ON LOL. WHY WOULD YOU MAKE A BOMB LIKE THAT LOL. best episode though \A Ep7: A couple minutes of intrigue surrounded by boring \A Ep8: didn't pay attention lul \A Ep9: two-parter, who cares \A Ep10: Why would the arbiters include a game that requires more than two people to play? This episode is relatively okay (purely based on the fact that the old lady is a childless mangaka) but has the pacing of a geriatric cancer patient. \A Ep11: Yagami backwards is I'm a gay. The music is boring. Nice animation though. \A Ep12: Someone in chat said \"this drama seems forced ngl.\" This is a show about arbiters of death making people play games in order to draw out intense emotion - all of the drama seems forced, lol. \"People just can't understand each other.

content: "\A Honestly, this movie is lazy as fuck. \A It seems like this movie primarily focuses on two themes: \"Living is about the connection you have with other people,\" and \"Death can happen at any time.\" But honestly, the way the movie handles these themes makes it seem as if they're contradictory - it can't focus on one without undermining the other. This is most apparent during Sakura's death and the aftermath. Sakura dies in a way entirely disconnected from the other characters, stabbed to death by some unnamed, no-faced rando, completely alone (as if the movie is trying to say, \"No matter how many relationships you have, you're going to die alone, lozer!\"). But the next time we see Sakura, she's in some pretty sundress, walking around a dreamscape, watering symbollic flowers and shit - the terror of Sakura's horrific, violent murder is completely swept under the rug in favor of the movie's more optimistic theme (\"Yeah, life may be full of tragedy, but who gives a shit! Living's totally worth it!\"). The movie attempts to tie together these wayward themes by throwing the viewer a bone, \"Look! Sakura read Haruki's message!\" But none of it works. \A About Sakura. Honestly, she feels like a completely static noncharacter. She only serves as a vehicle for these half-baked themes and as a plot device for Haruki's development. None of the things which happen to her actually FEEL like they're happening to her - she's dying, but she doesn't act like a dying girl. Even when she's stabbed to death, we never see her corpse, only the idealized image of Sakura in Haruki's head. Furthermore, Sakura's fucked-up behavior is never called out. She's basically holding her imminent death over Haruki's head in order to string him along on dates? But hey, maybe I'd be okay with all of this, if Sakura weren't such a big part of the movie, when the movie SHOULD be about Haruki. \A Haruki is honestly where the movie completely loses me. I mean, I like him. He's handsome, he's got a nice voice, he reminds me of me but not so much that I get disgusted. The problem is that the movie doesn't follow his character development at all. By the time Sakura dies 3/4ths through the movie, Haruki has decided... that he WANTS to become someone like Sakura. He hasn't actually taken any steps towards doing so. Like sure, he was dragged out of his comfort zone. Big whoopee. Real easy to do that when he's got an outgoing, extroverted girl like Sakura who goes out of her way to hang out with him and will literally forgive his every misstep and reacts to all of disagreeable traits with \"haha ur hilarious lol.\" The entire movie focuses on this shallow \"development\" instead of, you know, an actual point of conflict? The fact that he now has to try convincing each of his classmates to become friends with him? Most of whom dislike him, and will probably come to despise him once they find out he kept Sakura's terminal illness a secret? The movie skips over this entire plot point and just shows us the result of his off-screen character development in the epilogue, so it just feels entirely unearned. Also, his new haircut fucking sucks.";

For some reason she thinks their reaction will be jealousy instead of betrayal. 8) Creates a ghost to terrorize her grandpa, who ends up trying to kill and possess him. \"It was just a prank bro.\" 9) Gaslights a middle-aged lady into thinking she's going psychotic. 10) Traps one of her mascot characters in a pocket dimension, forcing the viewers to sit through a recap episode in order to save her. 11) Comes up with the stupidest method of communication and acts surprised when it horribly fails and causes misunderstanding drama. 12) Hysterically yells at a helpless, caged animal to \"Believe in human love\" while doing nothing to help it out of its situation. 13) Threatens someone with an allergy by bringing the allergen directly to their home. 14) Traps six people and one camel in an alternate dimension where they are under constant threat of being killed by giant insects. \A HOW DOES THIS SHOW HAVE THREE RECAP EPISODES. 14, 18, 22, WTF \A I actually do really like how Fukurokouji and Kunimitsu become less antagonistic as the series progresses.";

Even though she's not technically illegal I just find it a kinda fucking weird that this shit is in a kid's show for little girls. Also, HER ADULT FORM ISN'T EVEN HOT? Excuse me? \A Note: Momo is 12 years old physically, but since 1 year on Earth = 160 years on Fenarinarsa, she's actually around ~1920 years old. That means she has to wait 1000 years until she's an adult (and it also mean she might've spent up to 800 years in puberty...) \A In episode 45 Momo's transformation pendant gets shot by a gun and she unlocks Ultra Instinct. LOL. And in episode 46, Truck-kun hits her and she dies. LOOOOOOL \A The one thing I like about this show is that it brings back \"one-off\" characters for short cameos or even entire episodes.
