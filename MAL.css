I know it's because they want to explore pairings that don't involve all five of them, but it just feels weird because in the first three Precure, it was such a huge plotpoint that they NEEDED to hold hands in order to pull off their finishing moves. Also, more time replaying stock special move animations means less time spent on actual physical fight animation. The Fleurets are a particularly bad offender. \A The finale really ties everything together. This is the BEST Precure's symbolism and theming has been so far.";
