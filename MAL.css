Such a wide variety of good, interesting, memorable characters, who you can only help but to pity and hate at the same time. This is perhaps one of the only anime out there which cuts through all the bullshit - the villain is not a singular character, a singular group, a singular society or ideology. It is nature itself, animalistic and ruthlessly amoral, and everyone is at once a victim and a perpetrator of its rule. tldr SHIKI IS GOOD WATCH IT \A Also the music is PEAK DECULTURE.
