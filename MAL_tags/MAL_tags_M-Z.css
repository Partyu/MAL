It disappears while mid-air and they drop to what would have been their deaths, if Kyouhei hadn't saved them. 4) Steals property, allegedly worth one million yen, from her neighbor, only returning it once she realizes the property is worthless. 5) Creates dozens of fantastical creatures, which she lets roam around her room and out her window, thinking that nobody will see them and question what is going on. 6) Creates a personality-swapped copy of her neighbor, letting it roam around town and interact with the residents. 7) Attempts to fix her parents' marriage by creating two people and setting up two affairs. For some reason she thinks their reaction will be jealousy instead of betrayal. 8) Creates a ghost to terrorize her grandpa, who ends up trying to kill and possess him. \"It was just a prank bro.\" 9) Gaslights a middle-aged lady into thinking she's going psychotic. 10) Traps one of her mascot characters in a pocket dimension, forcing the viewers to sit through a recap episode in order to save her. 11) Comes up with the stupidest method of communication and acts surprised when it horribly fails and causes misunderstanding drama. 12) Hysterically yells at a helpless, caged animal to \"Believe in human love\" while doing nothing to help it out of its situation. 13) Threatens someone with an allergy by bringing the allergen directly to their home. 14) Traps six people and one camel in an alternate dimension where they are under constant threat of being killed by giant insects. \A HOW DOES THIS SHOW HAVE THREE RECAP EPISODES. 14, 18, 22, WTF \A I actually do really like how Fukurokouji and Kunimitsu become less antagonistic as the series progresses.";

Excuse me? \A Note: Momo is 12 years old physically, but since 1 year on Earth = 160 years on Fenarinarsa, she's actually around ~1920 years old. That means she has to wait 1000 years until she's an adult (and it also mean she might've spent up to 800 years in puberty...) \A In episode 45 Momo's transformation pendant gets shot by a gun and she unlocks Ultra Instinct. LOL. And in episode 46, Truck-kun hits her and she dies. LOOOOOOL \A The one thing I like about this show is that it brings back \"one-off\" characters for short cameos or even entire episodes.

Yuki's single-mindedly focused on her career, and Touya's stretching himself too thin. He's constantly being used and manipulated by the other girls while also stringing them along, unable to say no to them and push them away due to his disconnection with Yuki. It's a story about deeply flawed and thoroughly pathetic people falling in love with each other, and that's kindaaa cool. \A The atmosphere totally carries this show. The depressive music, the unorthodox split-screens, the sense of wrongness permeating every episode. The character acting animation really shines through in showing their feelings without words - and the text on screen, the literal thoughts of the characters, do a great job at fleshing out otherwise obscure scenes through telling. I especially love the moments where the backgrounds and characters take on a more painterly aesthetic, the moments where the characters are at their weakest emotionally, where they cling to the idealized image of the people they feel they can depend on. If anything, watch this for the atmosphere alone. \A Also I really want to play the VN but I'm a dumbass and can't set up a virtual machine lmao";

content: "\A The transformation sequence animations (for Dream, Rouge, and Lemonade especially) are AMAZING. \A I salute Hironori Tanaka for making the best two episodes of the show, 4 and 18, as beautiful as they are. \A Syrup's a mailman and that's why I like him. It's so cute that he looks up to Santa Clause... he's so cute. And as always, Miruku and Urara are great. \A The villains are pretty cool this time around. They're basically dimension-jumping curio collectors. Anacondy's got a cool design (and the actually-Medusa twist is FUCKING KINO), Shibiretta has a REALLY cool gimmick in her fairy tail pocket dimensions, Yadokhan and Isohgin are legitimately funny, Mucardia takes a new and deceitful approach, and Bunbee is forever. \A The one thing that really bothers me about this season is the Precure splitting up in fights and getting solo special moves. I know it's because they want to explore pairings that don't involve all five of them, but it just feels weird because in the first three Precure, it was such a huge plotpoint that they NEEDED to hold hands in order to pull off their finishing moves. Also, more time replaying stock special move animations means less time spent on actual physical fight animation. The Fleurets are a particularly bad offender. \A The finale really ties everything together. This is the BEST Precure's symbolism and theming has been so far.";
