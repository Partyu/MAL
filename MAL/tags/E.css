content: "\A So fucking overkill \A I can't think of a more boring way to start off a movie than with a cgi Mari fight scene \A I love the color red thank u anno kantoku \A Toji got cucked hard out of his pilot status and I'm still sad about it to this day \A Eva-shipping kills the soul, and yet I am embroiled in it \A I wish I could succumb to my yurifag instincts but Mari disgusts me on every possible level \A The reason I give more of a shit about Kawoshin in the Rebuilds is because this product is literally worthless to me outside of wish fulfillment and eye candy. I've said it time and time again, when I start to care about shipping it means the work itself has failed me. 3.33 already ruined the thematic significance of Kaworu's death by having him get killed by some stupid fucking dog collar instead of Shinji's own hands, so 3.0+1.0 might as well go all out and have these poor kids retire to the Bahamas and suck face or hold hands. But I didn't even get that... \A Ayanami Rei farming simulator and Shinji Ikari fishing simulator when \A Incredible Harry Potter epilogue vibes. When did Evangelion get so unbased \A Megumi Ogata's gasps sound really phoned-in for some reason \A Sorry but my eyes roll into the back of my head whenever a fight scene starts. I hate this cgi garbage, it's literally incomprehensible and full of useless visual noise. Gendo vs Shinji looks like actual trash, and GNR is a pathetic imitation. \A THIS MOVIE FEELS LIKE FNAF CUSTOM NIGHT \A I sure am glad that Anno's auteurism has produced a work whose only merit comes from standing on the shoulders of NGE, even as it constantly shits on it for the sake of a meta fairytale ending. Bravo Anno, you've made your autobiography. Save some manic pixie pussy for the rest of us geeks and freaks, I'm stuck in the mindset of a 14-year-old and it feels damn good. \A Can I really care about Gendo's backstory or Asuka's confession when NGE feeds into the Rebuilds but not the other way 'round? \A At least I finally got to see Misato's face, goodbye Rebuilds, I'm off to rewatch EoE";
