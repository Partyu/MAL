It looks like a more illustrative style brought to life in animation, and Akebi-chan herself is a perfect combination of cute and lowkey sexy. \A This is pretty much an anime about schoolgirls appreciating each others' feminine beauty, but it feels a little too voyeuristic and fetishistic at times. In some ways the \"lowkey sexiness\" of the characters is what contributes to this feeling; it's like the uncanny valley of erotic content - almost entirely pure, but with just a smidge of eroticism that makes it a bit offputting. I'm thinking too much about this lmao if you are a cute girl who likes cute girls then watch it";

Even though they're used a lot, they're so cute it doesn't matter. \A It's a bit strange to complain about slow pacing in an iyashikei show, but this is kind of ridiculous :I Can't believe it took twelve damn episodes for Teko to get to go diving in the ocean... \A When this anime goes educational, sometimes it feels like I'm watching a show for actual babies. \A Teko's blush is overkill \A THEY LOOK DRY \A It's kind of novel to see a digital photo frame in an anime. \A \"大好き\" bomb dropped, yurifag mode engaged";

At the very least, the death scenes and characters' reactions to them are nicely animated and expressed, and I appreciate how the narrative structure(?) changes after major reveals and plot twists. \A Sakakibara has way more going on than what I expected, going into this show. He wants to go to a fine arts school, he likes horror novels, he can cook, he's actually proactive in solving the mystery - on the other hand, Misaki's unexpectedly boring and her reticent demeanor works against her. Like when she just slowly walks away from poeple trying to shank her, or how she doesn't admit that Reiko is the extra until the last episode... \A Are there doujinshi about either of these two jerking off in the middle of class? lmao \A Dream sequence in episode 7 is sick, wish the entire show was so aesthetic.";
