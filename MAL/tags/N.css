content: "\A Was supposed to watch this for summer2016 but didn't for some reason \A Not to be a fucking coomer but my image of Hifumi is forever tainted by typehatena. \A I wonder if Aoba-chan would be a fan of the character designer/mangaka who created her. Imagine if she found out she was a fictional character and just being like \"What is this moeshit\" \A This is a show about severe autism. \A Why do cups not break when the characters drop them? One time they didn't even bother putting in a sound to indicate that one fell down and hit something. Fucking lazy. This show is constantly breaking my suspension of disbelief. Like, not even talking about how laidback the tone of the show is or how Aoba got this job straight out of fucking highschool. But every time the camera swings down to present a perfectly-angled shot of the characters' bodies I get taken out of the entire experience. Maybe if the characters were actually FUCKING HOT? BUT THEY'RE NOT? SO WHO GIVES A SHIT? YOU'RE JUST BREAKING MY SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF FOR NOTHING????!?!?!?!?!? \A I'm not falling for this fucking gaybaiting either. Kou x Rin https://myfigurecollection.net/item/331654 NSFW figure or GTFO. \A Umiko is the closest to being my type but her chuuni voice is completely offputting.";

content: "\A aka Battle of the Femboys \A Set design and effects are nice (I especially like the Dragon Palace), but most of character designs are ugly as sin. \A It bothers me that a lot of the comedy in this film is centered around characters being incompetent as hell. Nezha himself comes off as an edgy, impulsive, too-cool-for-school toddler, so it's hard to sympathize with him even when the movie straight up exposits his entire complex... \A Nezha and Ao Bing's friendship is the best part of the film, but so much time is spent on them beating each other up when they could have probably just talked it out. Whatever, they held hands and \"no  u\"ed God Futari-wa-Precure-style, I'll take it \A Nezha's mom is kinda badass, wish we got to see her in her armor more often \A Gonggong is cringe and the movie knows it lmao \A Even though the final fight scene drags on for way too long, the disguise spells make it pretty entertaining \A Maybe the subs were just shit or my attention span was just shit but this movie really didn't do a good job of explaining things. There were quite a few contrivances too. \A also obligatory F in the chat for GBF playable Nezha";
