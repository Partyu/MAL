Rei is fucking unbelievable and absolutely hard carries. \A I endorse the Rei x Eriko agenda \A This is an ugly bastard show and it honestly makes me kind of uncomfortable. Thankfully Kousuke's presence in this show decreases over time, plus he even gets fucking shot and put into a coma lmao. I'm consistently amazed by how willing this show is to traumatize its characters and fuck them up both mentally and physically. \A It takes a long fucking time for this show to reveal all the relationships going on behind the scenes, but once it does everything instantly makes sense. \A Osawa Hiroshi's singing is hilariously bad given how well it's regarded in-universe \A The Engrish is too powerful \A ngl I blacked the fuck out during that school play arc \A Goddamn why are the last episodes of these shows always so much better than the first 95%";

Admittedly the show does have some moments that might strain your suspension of disbelief, but the character writing is just so goddamn good that I can't help but be invested. \A Like ngl if this series had no CGI (discounting the OPs) it would def be a 9.";

content: "\A Banger OP \A This show has a surprisingly detailed ja.wikipedia page, considering how unknown it is in the West \A I can't handle all these Idol Densetsu Eriko cameos. Eriko in ep.1 and ep.32, Rei in ep.8, Nakata in ep.10, Ijuuin as a reoccuring character? Daaang \A I really dig the first few episodes. They genuinely succeed in conveying a sense of childlike whimsy, as these two now-homeless runaway children slowly work towards their dream jobs while sleeping in the parks of Tokyo, washing windows part-time, and completely baffling every adult they come across. The rest of the show is more or less a mixed bag, inundated with the kind of overly-wacky episodic storylines and hit-or-miss one-off characters you're oft to find in old kids anime. But at the very least, the introductory episodes did a hell of a good job of endearing me to the main characters and their newfound friendship - which is more than I can say for most shows of this type, and as a result they really work wonders for the experience as a whole. \A Youko basically having Seasonal Affective Disorder is such a good payoff to her \"ようこのようは太陽のよう\" line LMAO \A The fact that this anime ends with a FIFTY YEAR TIME SKIP, what a baller move";
