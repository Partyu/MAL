THAT SHOT OF HIM RUNNING THROUGH THE CROWD LOL. \A Imo, this was too slow-paced and the climax (and themes) are boring and predictable as fuck.";

content: "\A aka Are you Smarter than a Fifth Grader meets Mujaki no Rakuen \A Sound design gave me AIDS. The sound effects are all loud and obnoxious, the audio cues are so fucking unsubtle, Yuki Kajiura's BGM feels really out-of-place for some reason, and every character's voice is just downright weird. \A Also what the hell is up with that one high-pitched sound in the ED, my ears are in pain. At least the melody is okay when it's being used as a leitmotif? \A It's so weird whenever Satoru acts childish. Is he actually age-regressing or just really good at \"pretending\" to be retarded? I just can't believe that he's that good at acting when he's apparently dumber than fucking Kenya... More importantly, is he a pedophile or a hebephile ðŸ¤” \A Satoru's mom stopped Kayo's mom from slapping the shit out of her kid and didn't report it? Wtf? \A This 29-year-old man got beat by a malnourished 10-year-old girl at Othello...... \A A CHOCOLATE BAR TORE MY MARRIAGE APART \A Why is Satoru so fucking bad at keeping his thoughts to himself. \A Satoru's manga premise sounds pretty cool, but I don't trust this guy to write anything of substance. Hey, that sounds familiar... \A MODOREEEEEEEEEE (Satoru doesn't even sound like he's yelling lmao) \A THAT FOOTPRINT LMFAO \A Why is Satoru's mom straight up beating her child on the head TWICE played as a joke in a show ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. Were the sound effects just bass-boosted THEN too? Were they actually supposed to be LIGHT TAPS? WTF. \A Why. Why is the directing like this. Why does every clue come down to coloring something red or playing a loud ass fucking audio cue. Why doesn't the story bother with actually giving diagetic reasons why Satoru should suspect anyone other than pedo teacher man. Ultimately the show just comes off as fucking idiotic for trying to misdirect the viewer instead of the characters, and Satoru comes off as a fucking idiot for somehow being misdirected anyway.  \A Is it really that hard for a flexible young boy to slip out from under a seatbelt. \A Cool OP change? Cool voice swap post-coma? I guess he's not mentally 29 anymore? ...Okay? \A Named her kid Mirai... fucking Mirai... I see that we're continuing the cycle of abuse. \A Literally what is the functional purpose of building a gate on the rooftop of a hospital. Who would design this. Who would OK this decision. \A Man this show is gay. \A How did he throw the wheelchair that far. \A PLEASE tell me that he ends up writing Boku Dake ga Inai Machi in the future. PLEASE. JUST LET ME HAVE THIS \A This was a power of friendship show this entire time... \A Literally Life is Strange WHAT THE FUCK LMAO. CINEMATIC PARALLELS. KINO IMITATES KINO. \A I'm so fucking tired";

Very nice visuals with thin, wispy lineart and bold, solid coloring, and the setting is mildly interesting, but I couldn't care less about the story and characters. Seriously, I want to get engrossed in this beautiful, magical world, but all I can think while watching this is, \"I don't care.\" \A At least we have lesbian Hayami Saori uwu \A Bruno's spray-painted magic circles are really cool. His moving skellyman mask too, but imagine if he was a mouthbreather. \A Crown Council more like Clown Council \A Real talk how did they get through that entire explosion-filled fight scene without any clothing damage. Once you see the first shot of Cinderella absolutely ass-blasting Reverse London and the reaction shot of the characters just... not really caring about how ANYONE might've died... It just feels like it's MEANT to be high tension but we're barely shown the actual effects of anything that happens, so who gives a shit?";
