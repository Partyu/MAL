content: "\A Maquia's grip strength holy hell \A Whenever that baby speaks it's like he's talking into a tin can \A That flower pot sound effect sounds like shit \A Maquia's face just looks like it's melting... it's really hard to get me to like tareme eyes and this isn't working. I really don't like the shape of the character designs' faces in general. I guess the Iorph are meant to look childish, but some of the regular humans also look like blobs too? The sameface is strong too \A The voice acting for a lot of the secondary characters is like... that generic \"we don't want to hire generic anime voice actors\" voice, y'know. It ends up sounding like they're underacting, mumbling, or talking with grapes in their mouths. Really doesn't sell the drama lol. \A Sometimes this movie frames dramatic shots for scenes that REALLY don't deserve it. \"I'm sorry I said that, I'm sorry I said that,\" yeah, nobody gives a shit lol. Why do you get a upper-half-of-the-face-covered, downwards-view, center-screen, walking-towards-the-viewer shot for that lmao. It's overdramatic. Same with the music, it's so fucking heavy all the time. There's no levity at all. \a At least this movie has knights and armored horses and cool medieval stuff. I'd like to like the dragons too but the cgi is hideous. \A God they're really hammering in home the weird motherhood shit. \A The stray hairs trigger me \A In the end, I guess what this story is trying to say is that a 1000 year old immortal dragon loli will never love me romantically. I will always be her daughteru. :( \A I fucking adore how the medieval city looks. I'd love to see a movie exploring the innerworkings of the city and how it mechanically functions. \A Bro I hate Yuki Kaji's voice fr \A Krim cutting Maquia's hair reminds me of when I had naturally blonde tips and had to trim them off... sad times \A Childbirth is disgusting. this is a 1/10 sg2 bro \A I'm fucking bored. It sucks because the premise is so Partycore... why'd it have to be like this...";

content: "\A The most based and blackpilled anime \A This show is fucking amazing and only gets better on rewatches. It's so forthright in laying bare the savagery of nature and life, the atrocities that humans and animals commit in order to continue to survive and reproduce. Such a wide variety of good, interesting, memorable characters, who you can only help but to pity and hate at the same time. This is perhaps one of the only anime out there which cuts through all the bullshit - the villain is not a singular character, a singular group, a singular society or ideology. It is nature itself, animalistic and unsustainable and ruthlessly amoral, and everyone is at once a victim and a perpetrator of its rule. \A Also it has what is probably my favorite soundtrack ever. I listened to it for years before I watched the show and I still listen to it all the time even now. Favorite tracks are Eau de Vie and SHI-KI.";

Kaji Yuki and Amano Yuri are EXTREMELY lol. \A This show is just Pokemon \A wow \"infodump episode\" talented brilliant incredible amazing show-stopping spectacular never-the-same totally-unique completely-not-ever-been-done-before \A I love looking at shaky eyeballs mmm delicious \A Man this character acting is just not it \A tfw Saki is just Akane Tsunemori and I could be watching Psycho-Pass s1 rn \A tfw your Personality Index is just your Crime Coefficient and I could be watching Psycho-Pass s1 rn \A tfw I don't care about any of the characters and so everything that's happening means nothing to me \A Since they don't really set up limits for Cantus outside of \"people die when they kill\" I find myself constantly yelling at the characters to JUST USE YOUR POWERS. JUST USE THEM. DUDE. \A Even in the single scene where the characters are supposed to stay quiet so that they aren't tracked they just keep expositing........ \A Don't you just love when a series about how society fucking sucks ends with the main characters subjecting an innocent child to that very same society? Tbh they should have tried implementing a reproduction feedback along with the death feedback. Then all the Cantus users would naturally die out after a few decades and even in the rare case that a reproduction fiend shows up it still takes two to tango. Instead of perpetuating this world wherein everyone is a one-man army capable of inflicting harm onto tens of thousands of people, just like... stop? If they were able to code out murder is it really so hard to code out delayed murder?";

Spot coloring is delicious as well, though honestly it should have only been used for reds. \A ep2: The CGI looks so out of place. Needed a better song too tbh. \A ep3: I am gay, straight, bi, and ace for Hiroyuki Imaishi, and Sushio and Shigeto Koyama are my homies. An is cool as hell. \A ep4: How are all the character designs in this short so fucking sick. F is my wife now. \A ep5: Kara's kinda a qt and baller as fuck. I wish the fights had more detailed gore though. \A ep6: Unfortunately the novelty of it wears off pretty quick, so it just makes me think of how I like the aesthetic of Tetsuwan Atom 1980 so much more than this lol. Some of the scenes are kinda paced weirdly. \A ep7: Not You Yoshinari, I sleep. Ngl this kinda looks like shit. Sfx hurts my ears too. \A ep8: They gotta stop having these fair-skinned dark-haired ladies resolutely cut their braids bro, my heart already belonged to F and Oucho stole it away~! Also heartfelt adoption is based. \A ep9: Stop with these ear-piercing sfx plz. Also based villain route. If Masago had a cooler design this shit woulda made me coom.";
