My favorite would probably be Udon if the show were written better, but her voice, her face, the way she acts is all so run-of-the-mill and expected that it actually feels uncomfortable... like I'm watching a single really bad tvtropes article pretend to be human. The show just feels like it never ebbs and flows, so many episodes carry the same level of emotion and excitement all the way through, it's just really unengaging and weird, like I'm watching a botched facsimile of actual human life where everybody talks in the same customer service tone of voice for days on end. The most engaging eps are far and away the ones where Fuuka and Kukuru are allowed to take center stage without the boring af side charas butting in to remind us of their basic ass character traits. \A I'm fine with the idea of \"character discovers that their dream is actually something else\" considering this show managed to pull it off just fine in the first arc with Fuuka, but I really hate that Kukuru... basically just sucks it up and turns down an offer to do get paid for what she is passionate for and has literally been doing her entire fucking life in order to work a job that she hates with an incompetent, socially inept manager that namecalls and bullies her.

Otherwise it feels completely bog standard and boring to watch. Everything it does Fresh Precure does better. I stopped giving a shit at about the time it became clear they were just copy-pasting Eas into Siren. \A What really weirds me out about this Precure series is its main motif. With other series, it was pretty clear that shit like drought and desertification are bad things. But in this series, the Precure are fighting against... sad music? The implication is that art that conveys negative emotion has no right to exist, and it becomes all the stranger when you realize that the main villain's motivation of \"Removing all pain from the world by silencing all music\" seems to line up perfectly with the beliefs of the people we're supposed to be rooting for. \A The final moral of the series is the glib and generic \"Life is hard but it's still good\" message that End of Evangelion already perfected fifteen years ago, but the wording the protagonists use just puts a rotten taste in my mouth. Would the Precure tell a human trafficking victim, who's beaten and raped every day, to \"overcome their sadness, over and over again,\" because it'll let them \"become their true self?\" Remember that Noise is literally composed of ALL HUMAN SADNESS, every horrifying thing that's ever been inflicted on another human being, from slavery to war to death and despair.
