I really don't like the shape of the character designs' faces in general. I guess the Iorph are meant to look childish, but some of the regular humans also look like blobs too? The sameface is strong too \A The voice acting for a lot of the secondary characters is like... that generic \"we don't want to hire generic anime voice actors\" voice, y'know. It ends up sounding like they're underacting, mumbling, or talking with grapes in their mouths. Really doesn't sell the drama lol. \A Sometimes this movie frames dramatic shots for scenes that REALLY don't deserve it. \"I'm sorry I said that, I'm sorry I said that,\" yeah, nobody gives a shit lol. Why do you get a upper-half-of-the-face-covered, downwards-view, center-screen, walking-towards-the-viewer shot for that lmao. It's overdramatic. Same with the music, it's so fucking heavy all the time. There's no levity at all. \a At least this movie has knights and armored horses and cool medieval stuff. I'd like to like the dragons too but the cgi is hideous. \A God they're really hammering in home the weird motherhood shit. \A The stray hairs trigger me \A In the end, I guess what this story is trying to say is that a 1000 year old immortal dragon loli will never love me romantically. I will always be her daughteru. :( \A I fucking adore how the medieval city looks. I'd love to see a movie exploring the innerworkings of the city and how it mechanically functions. \A Bro I hate Yuki Kaji's voice fr \A Krim cutting Maquia's hair reminds me of when I had naturally blonde tips and had to trim them off... sad times \A Childbirth is disgusting. this is a 1/10 sg2 bro \A I'm fucking bored. It sucks because the premise is so Partycore... why'd it have to be like this...";

It's so forthright in laying bare the savagery of nature and life, the atrocities that humans and animals commit in order to continue to survive and reproduce. Such a wide variety of good, interesting, memorable characters, who you can only help but to pity and hate at the same time. This is perhaps one of the only anime out there which cuts through all the bullshit - the villain is not a singular character, a singular group, a singular society or ideology. It is nature itself, animalistic and unsustainable and ruthlessly amoral, and everyone is at once a victim and a perpetrator of its rule. \A Also it has what is probably my favorite soundtrack ever. I listened to it for years before I watched the show and I still listen to it all the time even now. Favorite tracks are Eau de Vie and SHI-KI.";

And of course this show skips over explaining the actual mechanics of wordless magic and why it's different from incanted magic, so what little intrigue this episode premise has even isn't expanded on.";

Tbh they should have tried implementing a reproduction feedback along with the death feedback. Then all the Cantus users would naturally die out after a few decades and even in the rare case that a reproduction fiend shows up it still takes two to tango.

content: "\A There's exactly one thing I find interesting about this Precure series and that's Hibiki and Kanade being former childhood friends and generally a bit antagonistic and catty towards each other. Otherwise it feels completely bog standard and boring to watch. Everything it does Fresh Precure does better. I stopped giving a shit at about the time it became clear they were just copy-pasting Eas into Siren. \A What really weirds me out about this Precure series is its main motif. With other series, it was pretty clear that shit like drought and desertification are bad things. But in this series, the Precure are fighting against... sad music? The implication is that art that conveys negative emotion has no right to exist, and it becomes all the stranger when you realize that the main villain's motivation of \"Removing all pain from the world by silencing all music\" seems to line up perfectly with the beliefs of the people we're supposed to be rooting for. \A The final moral of the series is the glib and generic \"Life is hard but it's still good\" message that End of Evangelion already perfected fifteen years ago, but the wording the protagonists use just puts a rotten taste in my mouth. Would the Precure tell a human trafficking victim, who's beaten and raped every day, to \"overcome their sadness, over and over again,\" because it'll let them \"become their true self?\" Remember that Noise is literally composed of ALL HUMAN SADNESS, every horrifying thing that's ever been inflicted on another human being, from slavery to war to death and despair. This message works up until you remember the sheer depth of humanity's capibility for suffering... most of the time people don't become better when they're hurt, they just get traumatized. Some shows acknowledge this, but yeah, this kiddie shit clearly doesn't fucking care.";
