content: "\A Wow, I've never heard Saitou Souma with such a deep voice before. (Well, deep for him lol) \A There's some nice character animation here and there, but why does this movie have the most basic bitch generic late 2010s TV anime romcom character designs imaginable? \A Just feels like it goes skin deep. None of the characters really get any development and there isn't really a sense that they've changed over the course of the film from interacting with each other, despite what they say. The most interesting character is Akari, but almost purely for her fucked-up home life rather than her personality in and of itself. (btw fuck her mom lmao what a bitch.) Even Kazuomi, who's got such a cool, interesting hobby, just gets completely shafted. The movie never shows him actually working on his craft (rather than just reading about it), so when he reveals that he was working on a short film for the entire first half of the story, I get some major whiplash. Did he even seem like he was busy? Or even trying? The other two are handled even worse. Rio is just not-blood-related-incest man and Yuna is zzzzzz-literally-who-cares. \A Also the subs for this were kind of fucking awful. I almost want to edit them myself. (Edit: I did) \A After watching this movie over and over and over again to fix those subs, I've grown a bit fond of it, though not so much so that my opinion's turned around for the better. Ultimately my distaste for it comes down to two things: These romantic relationships aren't ones I want to be in, and I fucking hate dumb misunderstanding drama lmao";

This movie is fine, but I can't really enjoy it when it's so set on glorifying biological motherhood. (If I just pretend they're adopted... they're adopted, they're adopted, they're adopted...) \A Probably gonna show it to my mom though lol \A I don't really like the water effects. They don't mesh with the rest of the background art. \A Why are Hana's eyes so far apart? Yuki's aren't too bad but they're still pretty silly-looking. \A Honestly it feels like the movie rushes through Yuki's and Ame's development way too fast. Like, Ame's some loser coward and then suddenly becomes a stone-cold badass runaway. They grow up so fast lol. But yeah, it feels pretty shallow, like the movie really wanted to fast-track them into becoming 100% human and 100% wolf. Gotta speedrun those themes!";

Plus the future segments feel way more intrusive and disruptive in the anime. I think the one thing the anime did better was get me to feel bad for Suwa (bros over hoes ðŸ˜”), but honestly it's been so long since I've read the manga that I can't really tell.  \A ALL OF NAHO'S FRIENDS LOOKING AT HER WITH DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN SHE FAILS TO SHARE HER UMBRELLA WITH KAKERU LMFAO \A How many times could these kids made things better by just taking a third option. It's not like Naho needs to choose between talking with Kakeru and letting Kakeru go back home to take care of his grandmother. Just say you understand his worries and go with him, wtf \A I understand that episode 12 is deliberately desaturated to show how bleak Kakeru's world is and distinguish it from the current timeline, but it just looks like a really shitty Instagram fukter \A How the hell was Hagita the only one to think \"Uh guys this plan is ridiculous.\" In hindsight, it's no wonder they fucked up so badly lmao. It would have been kind of funny if they had sent back instructions too, so if their alternate universe selves fucked up they could just try again with another timeline.";
