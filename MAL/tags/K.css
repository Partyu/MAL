The ideas behind Overlooking View are much more dependent on standalone ideas that are part of the shared human experience, rather than individual character concepts. And it just so happens that this idea - the feeling of being alone in a city full of people you don't know and who don't know you - is supported mostly by the movie's presentation of its setting. Every shot in this movie informs the setting, and the setting informs the ideas.

She's someone who's twice removed from normalcy, once by her lack of sensation and once again by her deception. I guess you could say that when one half of her abnormality was removed, she was unable to dispose of the other - just as she pretends to be hurt when her pain is external, she cannot bring herself to express it when it manifests internally, and so she hurts others to externalize the pain that she could not feel if she were to instead hurt herself. Is this some weird self-harm movie lmao? But while Fujino's perfectly fine as a concept, she's pretty unengaging as a character. She basically exists just to serve as a foil to Shiki, but when watching this movie, I can only feel unfulfilled. \A And I'm not going to say that the rape scenes are incredibly gratuitous, to the point of being immoral, but I do feel like this movie works best when it knows when to withhold information. Stuff like Shiki revealing that Fujino is smiling, and then - when Fujino is denying the fact - only framing shots of her from above her mouth.

content: "\A Honestly, this movie is lazy as fuck. \A It seems like this movie primarily focuses on two themes: \"Living is about the connection you have with other people,\" and \"Death can happen at any time.\" But honestly, the way the movie handles these themes makes it seem as if they're contradictory - it can't focus on one without undermining the other. This is most apparent during Sakura's death and the aftermath. Sakura dies in a way entirely disconnected from the other characters, stabbed to death by some unnamed, no-faced rando, completely alone (as if the movie is trying to say, \"No matter how many relationships you have, you're going to die alone, lozer!\"). But the next time we see Sakura, she's in some pretty sundress, walking around a dreamscape, watering symbollic flowers and shit - the terror of Sakura's horrific, violent murder is completely swept under the rug in favor of the movie's more optimistic theme (\"Yeah, life may be full of tragedy, but who gives a shit! Living's totally worth it!\"). The movie attempts to tie together these wayward themes by throwing the viewer a bone, \"Look! Sakura read Haruki's message!\" But none of it works. \A About Sakura. Honestly, she feels like a completely static noncharacter. She only serves as a vehicle for these half-baked themes and as a plot device for Haruki's development. None of the things which happen to her actually FEEL like they're happening to her - she's dying, but she doesn't act like a dying girl. Even when she's stabbed to death, we never see her corpse, only the idealized image of Sakura in Haruki's head. Furthermore, Sakura's fucked-up behavior is never called out. She's basically holding her imminent death over Haruki's head in order to string him along on dates? But hey, maybe I'd be okay with all of this, if Sakura weren't such a big part of the movie, when the movie SHOULD be about Haruki. \A Haruki is honestly where the movie completely loses me. I mean, I like him. He's handsome, he's got a nice voice, he reminds me of me but not so much that I get disgusted. The problem is that the movie doesn't follow his character development at all. By the time Sakura dies 3/4ths through the movie, Haruki has decided... that he WANTS to become someone like Sakura. He hasn't actually taken any steps towards doing so. Like sure, he was dragged out of his comfort zone. Big whoopee. Real easy to do that when he's got an outgoing, extroverted girl like Sakura who goes out of her way to hang out with him and will literally forgive his every misstep and reacts to all of disagreeable traits with \"haha ur hilarious lol.\" The entire movie focuses on this shallow \"development\" instead of, you know, an actual point of conflict? The fact that he now has to try convincing each of his classmates to become friends with him? Most of whom dislike him, and will probably come to despise him once they find out he kept Sakura's terminal illness a secret? The movie skips over this entire plot point and just shows us the result of his off-screen character development in the epilogue, so it just feels entirely unearned. Also, his new haircut fucking sucks.";

content: "\A I'll just say it up front; I gave this movie a 1 because of the Hanekawa Araragi boob scene. I am not exaggerating when I say that it disgusted me more than any other piece of fiction I've ever consumed. I think it's because of how the scene is clearly animated and acted to be seriously sexualized and titilating for the audience, despite being treated as little more than a comedic joke with zero ramifications for Araragi's actions. In comparison to rape scenes which are handled with an appropriate level of sobriety, lighthearted erotic fanservice scenes in lighthearted erotic shows, or even just straight-up hentai, it's just fucking repulsive. All it does is my chest hurt and cause me to think of things I don't want to remember. \A I really find myself frustrated with Hanekawa and Araragi's views towards suicide as well. It's ridiculous to call someone selfish for wanting to commit suicide when forcing someone to continue to suffer just for your own happiness is far more insidious and narcisstic. It's especially angering when Araragi refuses to treat Kiss-Shot humanely by heeding her wishes and killing her, putting an end to the life she doesn't want. Rather than extending even the tiniest bit of empathy towards her, he basically fucking cripples her and makes her completely dependent on him, so yeah, that's great I guess. \A The fight scene's well-animated, but there's a lot of silly moments which just kill the tension. Overall, I like Tekketsu's subway scene better when it comes to the uncanny dismemberments, and Nekketsu's Hanekawa intestine scene better when it comes to the gore. \A Pupa is based \A As always, just watch Shiki";
