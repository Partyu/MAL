Galactic Railroad's droning sound effects and slow pacing really sell its purgatorial setting, but I'd honestly prefer something more dense. \A I love the Campanella's and Giovanni's dead-eyed stares. They're real cute and the character designs (at least the cats) all feel solid and huggable.";

Like the way some scenes are framed just makes it TOO obvious what the punchline is going to be, so by the time the scene finally arrives at it, it's so boring that it completely falls flat.\A I appreciate the food porn, but it just makes me all the more sad for my raw egg intolerance.............. \A OP and ED are annoying and sound like hick shit \A Mikage looks like an AssClass character so I don't trust her \A I dig how unique this show's focus and themes are. It's got the same appeal as a nyuugyuu life. But the human characters are all kind of boring.";

content: "\A OP is a banger \A The scene in episode 3 where the new members of the adventuring party stop together to eat and share their cultures' foods really made me invested in the idea of the them as a group of unlikely friends and compatriots working together towards one shared goal. I often find that these sort of new fantasy anime are unconvincing on the \"fantasy food\" front, so it's immediately interesting to see one that not only features different food cultures but also different cultures' reactions to each other's food cultures. TLDR; it makes this anime like 2x better, and every scene after it is improved merely by its existence \A As a fan of choir music the special ED for ep7 pleases me \A I enjoy how Goblin Slayer uses his 200IQ deductive brain, hardened by years of battle and war, to determine simple things like ice cream probably being sweet \A \"Even in my dreams, you will come?\" \"Yeah\" is such a baller exchange tbh \A The most offensive content in this show is Majo's speaking style \A That last scene where he took off his helmet got me feeling some type of way";

At least the ED is a banger \A Gotoubun has committed the great harem anime sin of having shit art and zero appealing personalites. Amazing job guys. Watch Baby Steps, Sansha Sanyou, and Ouran High School Host Club instead. I just have no will in my heart to complete this \A Though tbh the number related jokes are kinda funny";

Cute as fuck. \A Chiren's voiced by Koyama Mami, she gives me Minky Momo PTSD. I love her hairstyle though. It's the perfect mix of messy and elegant. \A \"Spine theft\" is baller as fuck and I love it. \A OMG. Gally just straight up confessing to Yugo, kabedoning him so hard she shatters the window behind him, and Yugo replying, \"I guess we're partners in crime now,\" with Gally following up with a kiss, IS SO FUCKING HOT. Yugo and Gally's scenes together are so good. From their first meeting, to Gally straight up feeding her blood into his arteries to save him from death... GODDAMMIT ALL TO HELL.
