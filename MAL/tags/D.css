content: "\A GENSHISURU KAMI \A The new footage really threw me off guard, having just come off of rewatching the series and all. \A L looks like a lost puppy when he's standing in the rain and it makes me sad. Light having to kill the only friend he's ever made, the only person who was able to understand him, makes me sad. :( \A Though ngl it was kind of fucking weird that this movie didn't include the shot of Light evilly smiling down at L, confirming L's theory right before his death and letting him know that they've both won. Like okay, just skip out on the part where L realized that he was totally right before dying contented. this shit is gay \A dat graveyard scene tho \A I'm kind of confused as to the death scenes at the end of the film? Why didn't Light kill those guys with the standard heart attack? \A These are some sick end credits \A \A L WO TSUGU MONO \A L came back from the dead to emcee for the movie LOL \A The scene with L doing a Zoom conference in Wammy's House is so fucking sad. I'm sad again. Bruh \A Should Mikami really be killing non-criminal Kira dissenters? \A GODDAMN this rewrite sure skips a lot of shit. \A There's no wiretapping in Takada and Light's hotel room? Lol what? THEY JUST HAD SOMEONE STAND OUTSIDE THE DOOR? LOL WHAT? \A Okay, they starting wiretapping. I hate that this film actually put in the sounds of paper crinkling that the show lacked. (Granted, since I wasn't wearing headphones while rewatching there's a possibility I just didn't hear it lol) \A God the color work in that extra shot of Matsuda and what's-his-face opening the door is fucking immaculate \A \A Anyway you should probably just watch a compilation of the new scenes, I'm sure that someone's uploaded one on YouTube by now. The first movie's boring and the second movie makes things even more ridiculous than they were before.";

content: "\A Based off what I can remember, Death Billiards' rules and setup were better. \A When it comes to this show, \"Episodic anime with an overarching plot\" essentially means \"We'll spend 20 minutes every episode focusing on characters who you don't care about, who aren't interesting, and who you'll never see again, and maybe if we have a minute or two leftover we'll dripfeed you information about the characters who actually matter.\" The information comes in so slowly, that by the time the show has decided \"We're ready to focus on the overarching plot now!\" I just can't bring myself to care. \A The first half of the show is basically trying to say, \"Average people react to extreme situations with extreme emotions.\" But the show's structure just makes this fucking boring. Either make the show non-episodic and focus on a few, tightly-written character arcs, that actually show a steady progression from point A to point B. Or drop the \"average\" schtick entirely and make the one-offs some crazy, charismatic motherfuckers who immediately command your attention. It's not as if episodic, one-off characters can't work, either. Just make them secondary and put the focus on the reoccuring cast. Decim and the woman end up feeling like side characters in their own goddamn show. Do we even get to see what Decim judgements were? Do we even get that little amount of characterization? This anime is 75% padding, and the 25% of actual content is so sparse and so shallow. \A Ep1: breeder shit, zzzzzzz \A Ep2: Wow I sure do love the show deciding we as the viewers are too fucking stupid to analyze the themes of the first episode and come to a conclusion about the characters' actions ourselves given the clues the script and visuals provide. \"Wow haha he didn't miss the board on purpose haha humans sure are interesting!\" Dude this shit is so fucking boring. Just the writers circlejerking about their own script. It's not an inherently boring idea, but at least pull it with interesting characters and an interesting conflict instead of two fuck-off nobodies and their paternity testing. \A Ep3: Maybe this would be cute if I actually gave a shit about any of these people? Everybody in this show is a fucking normie, reeeee. Why would I care about a twist if I don't care about the characters? \A Ep4: The girl's seiyuu fucking sucks at crying. Fighting game animations are entertaining, but the game itself is wayyy more passive. The most interesting part of the episode is Decim being a dick lol. \A Ep5: So like what happens when a baby who died one minute out the womb comes to Quindecim? I got excited when the kid turned heel, but in the end only the recurring characters can have fun personalities, huh.... Also Ginti looks really bad from the front. His head and neck look too big for his body. \A Ep6: Cool to see another set. ...uh, why do they have to pee in purgatory? Aren't they dead? That pantsu shot audio cue lmao. HOW IS HE GRABBING ON LOL. WHY WOULD YOU MAKE A BOMB LIKE THAT LOL. best episode though \A Ep7: A couple minutes of intrigue surrounded by boring \A Ep8: didn't pay attention lul \A Ep9: two-parter, who cares \A Ep10: Why would the arbiters include a game that requires more than two people to play? This episode is relatively okay (purely based on the fact that the old lady is a childless mangaka) but has the pacing of a geriatric cancer patient. \A Ep11: Yagami backwards is I'm a gay. The music is boring. Nice animation though. \A Ep12: Someone in chat said \"this drama seems forced ngl.\" This is a show about arbiters of death making people play games in order to draw out intense emotion - all of the drama seems forced, lol. \"People just can't understand each other. It's wrong to want to understand each other.\" Damn bro, you're telling me I could have been watching Synecdoche this whole time?";

When she eats ramen how badly does her hair stick to her forehead from the sweat and steam? Lol. But real talk, no girl whose cuteness increases that much when she parts her bangs would just leave her hair hanging in front of her head 24/7, especially when they'd be so inconvenient irl, unless she's been sexually abused and can't handle being seen as attractive. (Is my suspension of disbelief really gonna break over hair of all things? One of my favorite shows is Shiki btw LOL) \A Delusional characters aren't interesting until we at the very least see the reasons for their delusions, and these characters' reasons aren't very good at all... \A Episode 2 is more interesting but still not very good. Meh, the director did as good as he could with what he was given.";

Everything that happens feels like it's just another story beat on a checklist. \A The only noteworthy thing is the music, but its inclusion is so dissonant - the soundtrack is loud and high tempo, but everything it's played over is just boring. Nothing that happens has any sense of impact, whether in the animation or narrative. \A Was it necessary for pink chick to jump off the roof instead of just staying up there? \A I hope to god the Arknights anime isn't like this... but the base quality of Arknights' main story doesn't give me much hope... \A At least the OP and ED tracks are pretty good.";
