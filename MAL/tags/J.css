content: "\A Why doesn't the English title have an Oxford Comma \A I feel like I got more diving scenes in the first minute of this film than in an entire season of Amanchu \A Chromatic aberration is ridiculous at times, specifically in the scene where Josee and Mai are duking it out on the bridge \A Music is a HUGE detriment, it's way too loud and conspicuous and heavy-handed and comes off as more emotionally-manipulative than anything. Which is a shame because this movie totally had me in its pocket. I cried like four times. \A I don't particularly like the car accident plot point. Felt like it made the movie's lesson a bit too obvious, not to mention that physical therapy montage gave me hardcore ERASED flashbacks lmao. At least Tsuneo is able to fully heal by the end of the film. Maybe I would have liked it more if they gave us a LiveLeak gore shot. (I'm being 100% serious) \A The second easiest way to make me like a character is to make them super hard-working and ambitious. The easiest way to make me love a character is to make them super hard-working and ambitious and a visual artist. It's so fucking cathartic. Just seeing that seconds-long shot of Josee being completely mesmemerized by the art stores' collection of blue paints was enough to make me bawl my eyes out. \A Color design is absolutely fucking perfect, I love those oranges and dark greens/teals. Background art looks fantastic, especially the folliage and the shots of Josee's home. \A Anyway, good movie, wish it had an Oxford Comma and a better OST though \A Also shoutout to the three people who bought tickets for Kimetsu no Yaiba and went to the wrong theatre lmfao";

content: "\A For a battle shounen it's strangely lacking in hype - probably because I'm not invested in any of the characters. Honestly throughout watching this show I just kept thinking about how much I wish Part 1 Naruto could get a faster-paced adaptation that looks this good. no cap \A Nanami makes this anime twice as engaging whenever he's on screen. \A Horror sound cues are lmfao. I really wish this show was legit scary, but it isn't in the slightest. \A -SSU~! REEEEEEEEEEEE \A The art design is mostly fantastic, but god do I fucking hate that airbrush shading this and other anime do. It just makes the characters look flat and gray and like their skin is rotting and smeared with shit. \A Some of the aspects of the power system are really cool (and I think I'd like it a lot if I actually cared about the characters) but the \"Exposition dump to your opponent about your powers\" pact almost always feels like a cheap writing hack, with the sole exception of Toudou's fake claps. \A TLDR some parts are cool, some parts are boring as shit, I don't have any strong feelings either way";

As in, literally the plot of a fanfiction I read earlier lmao. \A Why is hentai animation so fucking rancid and sexless. Just release drama CDs for us to listen to while reading the manga, swear to god \A WTF IS THAT BGM LMAO?
