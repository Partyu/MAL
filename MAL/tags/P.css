Hoshino still a cutie \A I wonder how they animated the moving patterns and text on Hoshino's bow. \A ayooo Bacchus bros \A Why doesn't Jena-san have a MAL entry >:( \A Bruh. When I realized he was making them a planetarian. KINO. \A That being said, I really do think that Hoshino and Kuzuya's chance meeting is the core of this story, and that everything that happens after the timeskip is largely unnecessary and boring. I don't need closure lol. Just watching Hoshino and Kuzuya interact is enough for me. \A Isaiah kinda has a cute outfit/color scheme \A 128 EB WTF \A The last thirteen minutes of this movie cucked me hard. STOP DREAMING AND PUT THE CARD IN THE ANDROID JESUS CHRIST. Fuck them kids \A tldr I cried";

I mean I guess I could see that sort of thing happening in real life, since robots ARE stealing our jobs (lol) but I figured that a society technologically advanced enough to have androids like Hoshino would have already moved past that. \A I used to collect snowglobes, so I know how worthless they are LOL \A WHY ARE THERE STATUES THAT LOOK LIKE REALISTIC IRL PEOPLE? WHAT \A Swear to god this shit is just Astro Boy. I was thinking that while watching the movie but hearing \"As a robot, I can't lie\" right after watching a Tetsuwan Atom episode that used the exact same idea as a plot point just hammers it in lol. \A \"If I were a boy, I would've proposed to you\" YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ROBO-YURI \A \"Just kidding!\" FUCK. GODDAMMIT ALL TO HELL. \A I self-identify as the little kid who asked Hoshino to marry him. Just forget the part where he had to cancel their engagement nine years later, in front of his girlfriend \A You guys had the plot center around a ten-year anniversary when you're celebrating the VN's fifteen-year anniversary?

Rather than these basic references I wish we got to see more of the Precure interacting. They don't really get to meet each other until two-thirds of the movie have already passed, so honestly it kinda fails as a fanservice movie for me. I must admit the first half of the final fight is awesome though. \A So nice to see Cure White and Cure Black beat the shit outta spooky dooks after all these years \A Some of the character acting is really great \A Those OP cues are immaculate";

Too bad about the CGI though. \A Since all the Precure sans Heartcatch are already acquainted, this movie gets into the groove of things a lot faster than its prequel. But with so many characters, there isn't enough time for most of them to get adequate focus. It'd be really cool if we could get crossover movies with only two or three Precure groups at a time. The best part of the movie was the scenes where Heartcatch and Fresh were just chilling out with each other, everything after that was kinda fun but definitely worse. \A So glad to see both reformed antagonists AND evil motherfuckers get the cameos they deserve :') More Kaoru, Michiru, Bunbee, and NORTHA content \A Okay but why is the villain called Bottom and why is he trying to get the Rainbow Jewel \A Did half of the mascots forget they could fly? \A Tbh I enjoyed the final fight more when it was a Heartcatch Precure OP...";

Which is a shame because I'd love to see some of these characters all grown up. \A God they're all so fucking moe \A The framing and animation actually do a damn good job at conveying the monsters' size and scale \A That Max Heart music cue was absolutely perfect \A The Precures' reanimated final moves are fucking beautiful \A It's a shame that they didn't get one big 21-man combo attack for the final blow though, and the break before the boss fight dragged on a little too long.";
