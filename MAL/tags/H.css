content: "\A Aight, it's been over four years since I've watched Haikyuu. Obviously it's because it's a recap movie, but none of the emotional beats really hit at all. \A Some other misc notes: Hinata's voice is annoying. Kageyama reminds me of Noel from Burn the Witch. I still don't like Tsuki, lmao. Yamaguchi is discount Furihata, and since his pinch serve isn't in this movie who really gives a shit about him lmao. Nishinoya's angry face is edgy and I can't take it seriously. I can't believe they cast Kamiyan as some rando faculty advisor... The number of times they beat in that Crow vs Cat imagery, like seriously, get some new visual symbolism pls. And I've always hated the way the netting goes transparent, as if they think we can't see the characters' faces and expressions if there are a couple of straight lines drawn over them. \A That slice-of-life scene in the dark hallway at night... Please, I just want the Kuroko no Basuke Replace novels to be animated. PLEASE, I WANT TO SEE AKASHI AGAIN ;;;-;;;";

It's fun to see how fast the characters and teams adapt to each others' tactics. I like Sugawara and Kageyama's foiling and I still love the unexpected loss. Though Oikawa as annoying and dislikeable as ever lmao. \A This movie, I really started noticing the music. It's really good! I feel like I never noticed it while watching the series lol.";
