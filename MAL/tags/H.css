Obviously it's because it's a recap movie, but none of the emotional beats really hit at all. \A Some other misc notes: Hinata's voice is annoying. Kageyama reminds me of Noel from Burn the Witch. I still don't like Tsuki, lmao. Yamaguchi is discount Furihata, and since his pinch serve isn't in this movie who really gives a shit about him lmao. Nishinoya's angry face is edgy and I can't take it seriously. I can't believe they cast Kamiyan as some rando faculty advisor... The number of times they beat in that Crow vs Cat imagery, like seriously, get some new visual symbolism pls. And I've always hated the way the netting goes transparent, as if they think we can't see the characters' faces and expressions if there are a couple of straight lines drawn over them. \A That slice-of-life scene in the dark hallway at night... Please, I just want the Kuroko no Basuke Replace novels to be animated. PLEASE, I WANT TO SEE AKASHI AGAIN ;;;-;;;";

content: "\A The best full-series entry in the Precure franchise so far, only beaten by the Yes! 5 movie due to its consistency. \A I love all four of the characters. Tsubomi's character growth by the finale is fantastic, Erika's consistently entertaining, Itsuki's a great take on a conflicted crossdresser character, and Yuri's badass elegance and tragic story carry the show through its entire second half. \A Sasorina+Kumojacky+Cobraja could be better though, they weren't as interesting or fun both individually and together like the Fresh Precure! four. Though the epilogue shots definitely won me over. At the very least we have Dark Precure, who, exactly like her counterpart Cure Moonlight, is a perfect combination of badassery and tragedy. \A THIS ANIMATION'S GONNA MAKE ME COOOOOOM \A Finale arc was nigh perfect from start to finish, four episodes of pure sublimity. \A While I wish the show's monster-of-the-week episodes were stronger, it really surprised me with how it handled some conflicts differently from (read: better than) past Precure series. Overall, they were an improvement, but I still wish they even came close to the quality of the finale. \A This show legit has deep lore and it's fucking awesome. I love how much it calls back to backstory elements, it truly makes the story feel like it's taking place on a grand and epic scale. \A TLDR TAKE THE MAHOU SHOUJO PILL.";

The dragon fight was particularly disappointing, given how quickly it ended - I was expecting a second round of hand-to-hand and powerups after Super Silhouette, but I guess that was enough. It didn't give me the same epic feeling as the finale of the show, and neither was it as emotionally poignant. I mean, I think being locked up for centuries is a good enough reason to want to destroy the world lmao. \A Glad the movie had a focus on our pre-established main characters and lore, rather than focusing on a whole other world as past Precure movies were ought to do. I've always loved Heartcatch's handling of lore, so seeing it expanded on in this movie was a pleasant surprise!";

Even though the show's presentation isn't mind-blowingly amazing like Heartcatch Precure, the animators and newbie voice actresses do a great job of selling how fucking cute they are. \A I love how much of an idiot Reira is, Natsuki's surprisingly charming at times, and Wish is actually a great character. Ringo's there too I guess :P Her naivety is pretty sweet. \A TL;DR cute kids anime";
