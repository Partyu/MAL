The second half of this show is built on the shaky foundation of Papika's and Cocona's relationship, which doesn't really get any farther than \"You'll be invested in this, they're cute lesbians right? You like cute lesbians right??\" Their dynamicis boring at best and creepy at worst... Even episode 7 just ends up reminding me of how many ways their relationship could have been made more interesting...";

So over these fucking boring and unbearably LONG magic attacks. \A Buki is moe :3 \A ED1 is actually a bop \A Tbh I hate how Chiffon is handled. Feels like the show is just pushing some weird maternal childcare agenda on its young, impressionable audience of little girls, what with the relationship between Miki/the Precures and Chiffon literally likened to that of a mother and her child. At least Chiffon is techinically adopted ig. \A In many ways, Fresh differs from the pre-established Precure formula. Sometimes it really fucks with my suspension of disbelief, but it also leads to some really great theming, so all in all I appreciate it. \A Eas is Kaoru and Michiru perfected. \A All of the villains are so fucking good and I love their chemistry";

I love how the karate toy is animated too. Even if their fights feel like a pointless diversion. \A The final fight music goes hard \A Even if it isn't as good as the show itself, this movie at least emotionally links the main character with the central conflict, which is more than I can say for most other Precure films. Still kinda disappointing though ngl, especially since they gave up and used CGI for a really important scene. \A Toymajin is fucking adorable and I'm actually crying";

Nice OP colors though \A Who was the genius who cast Takahiro Sakurai and Hiroshi Kamiya as the two main characters because I just want to give them a firm handshake and say thank you \A Seeing Micchan's glasses fog up when he eats hot food and him having to wipe them is :O This series has really great character animation and attention to detail. \A I really like the art style of the post-episode scenes. It reminds me of White Album. \A I love how messy and tightly-packed so many of the sets are. \A Just like Bakuman, I really wish this show went full-in on the dictionary shit instead of putting so much focus on romance. I just wanna see Micchan and Nishioka talk endlessly about words and definitions and etymology. But even though I am a bit disappointed with where the show puts its focus, I do enjoy how both of their relationships are handled fairly maturely. \A Episode 7 is gold all the way through. Nishioka straight pimpin' and a baller, as to be expected from a Kamiyan kyara \A Did they just timeskip more years than this show has episodes? While I understand why it was necessary in order to wrap up the series, and they handled it pretty well all things considered, I wish they hadn't needed it.";
